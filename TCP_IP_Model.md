# The TCP/IP Model 
### I would say the TCP/IP model is a better version of OSI model and it has just 4 layers .

| TCP/IP Model | Protocols and services |
|--------------|------------------------|
| 4- Application | HTTP , FTP , Telent , SSH , DHCP ... |
| 3- Transport | TCP , UDP |
| 2- Network | IP , ARP , ICMP , IGMP |
| 1- Network Access  | Ethernet |
