# The OSI Model 
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network .
|Data | Layer | Functions |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| Data | 7- Application | Human-computer interaction layer, where applications can access the network services |
| Data | 6- Presenation | Ensures that data is in a usable format and is where data encryption occurs |
| Data | 5- Session | Maintains connections and is responsible for controlling ports and sessions |
| Segments | 4- Transport | Transmits data using transmission protocols including TCP and UDP |
| Packets | 3- Network | Decides which physical path the data will take |
| Frames | 2- Data Link | Defines the format of data on the network |
| Bits | 1- Physical | Transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium |
